### question a:

Configure the queue as a single FIFO with a very large capacity (K = âˆž). Conduct simulations for various offered loads
from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1. Compare the average statistics with the theoretical averages. If the simulation results
deviate from the theoretical averages, provide an explanation.

<strong>offered load: a measurement of traffic backlog in the Q</strong>
